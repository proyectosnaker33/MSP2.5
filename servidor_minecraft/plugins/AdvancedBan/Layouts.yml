# Message-Layouts can not only be used for bans but also for mutes and warns
# Currently available variables:
#   %OPERATOR% - The user who dealt the punishment.
#   %REASON% - Reason for punishment.
#   %PREFIX% - Prefix set in Message.yml.
#   %DURATION% - Amount of time left before a punishment expires (will be -1 for permanent punishments).
#   %DATE% - Date punishment was issued on.
#   %ID% - Displays the punishment ID (i.e. first punishment = 0, second punishment = 1, third punishment = 2, etc.)
#   %HEXID% - Displays the punishment ID in base 16. 
# For warns you have also the variable %COUNT% which will be
# replaced with the current amount of warns the player already received
# Example usage: /ban Leoko @ExampleLayout
