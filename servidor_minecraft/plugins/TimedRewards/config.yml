# /Information
# Timed Rewards is a plugin much alike Hypixel's 'Delivery Man'
# and Mineplex's 'Carl the Creeper' in which players can claim
# rewards over set periods of times.
#
# If you have an invalid setting, the plugin will do its best
# to use its default setting without causing any issues.
#
# If you have any questions, suggestions, features you'd like
# to see added or report any bugs, please post them in the
# discord server above.
#
# The premium version of Timed Rewards offers multiple reward
# menus, NPCs, unclaimed and claimed items, vote rewards, full
# in-game management and much more. For more information,
# visit the plugin page: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/46501/
# for questions, feel free to ask in the Discord Support Server.
